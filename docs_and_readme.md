** INSTALLATION FOR THE TOOL AS A CONSUMER**
 - node and npm installed
 - npm i <package_name> //to be added later
 - see docs for more info about using

** ANOTHER USECASE FOR THE TOOL **
 - if you often need to pase more that one file to chatGPT this tool can help generate a map of the direcotory and then paste it to chatGPT
 - disclaimer -> feauture is not fully implemented yet and in the future with my-command --map you it will automatically copy it to your clipboard
 - to help with chatGPT usgae you will also be able to define a file in which you will put things for chata like dont write comments ...

** THINGS TO IMPLEMENT **
 - add working urls to the api
 - add things to package.json for convinience
 - write docs
 - finish chatGPT helper and implement --commnets to add dont write comments to the code but keep existing one to the pasted clipboard

** DISCLAIMER ** 
 - when modyfying the templater logic it is reccomneded to be tested in a selected envirometn since if you use chatGPT it can spit up code that can mess up your files and folders
